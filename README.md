The task at hand is to design a suitable simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI) to teach small children about the different rules of geometry and solid geometry. The simulator will provide an interactive learning experience by displaying various geometric shapes and their corresponding formulas or rules for problem-solving. Additionally, the GUI will include visual representations of the shapes to enhance the child's understanding and engagement.

To implement this task, we will develop a Python program using the PyQt5 library, which provides tools for creating GUI applications. The program will consist of a main window that displays the different geometrical shapes and their associated rules.
1.	GUI Design:
•	The main window will include a shape selector, where the child can choose a specific shape to learn about.
•	Once a shape is selected, an image of the shape will be displayed to provide a visual reference.
•	Below the shape image, there will be a text box that shows the rules and formulas related to the selected shape. This text box will be read-only and display the relevant information for the child to learn from.
•	The main window will also include a problem-solving section, where the child can enter the necessary parameters for a specific shape.
•	The program will provide a "Solve" button, which, when clicked, will calculate and display the solution based on the entered parameters.
•	The solution will be shown in a separate text box, allowing the child to see the result of the problem-solving process.
2.	Shape Information:
•	The program will support various geometric shapes such as triangles, rectangles, squares, circles, trapezoids, cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and pyramids.
•	For each shape, the simulator will provide the corresponding rules and formulas required to solve problems related to that shape.
•	The rules and formulas will be displayed in the text box based on the shape selected by the child.
3.	Problem-Solving:
•	The child will be able to enter the necessary parameters for the selected shape in the problem-solving section of the GUI.
•	Depending on the shape, the program will calculate the solution using the appropriate formulas and display the result in the solution text box.
•	If the child does not provide all the required parameters, an error message will be displayed, prompting them to enter the missing values.
4.	Interactive Learning Experience:
•	The graphical representation of each shape will help the child visualize the shape and its characteristics.
•	By providing clear rules and formulas, the child will learn the necessary steps to solve problems related to each shape.
•	The interactive nature of the GUI, with input fields and a solve button, will engage the child in the problem-solving process and reinforce their understanding of geometry concepts.
By implementing this simulator with a user-friendly GUI, we aim to create an educational tool that enables small children to learn about geometry and solid geometry in an interactive and engaging manner.
